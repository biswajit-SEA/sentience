15/05/25, 9:02â€¯am - user1: Iâ€™m Rahul Sen. I wanted some help regarding a transaction I made yesterday.
15/05/25, 9:03â€¯am - user2: Good morning Rahul. Sure, I can help you with that. Can you please provide more details of the transaction?
15/05/25, 9:03â€¯am - user1: Yes. I transferred â‚¹15,000 from my savings account ending with 0911 to another SBI account around 3:45 PM yesterday. The amount got debited but the beneficiary hasn't received it.
15/05/25, 9:04â€¯am - user2: Okay, let me quickly check the transaction logs. Please hold for a moment.
15/05/25, 9:06â€¯am - user2: Thank you for waiting. I can confirm the transaction was successfully processed from our end at 3:47 PM. Sometimes it may take up to 24 hours if there's a delay at the beneficiaryâ€™s bank.
15/05/25, 9:06â€¯am - user1: Oh okay. The person hasnâ€™t received it yet. Should I ask them to check with their bank?
15/05/25, 9:07â€¯am - user2: Yes, please advise them to check their statement or contact their bankâ€™s support. Meanwhile, if the amount isnâ€™t credited by 3:47 PM today, you can raise a complaint, and weâ€™ll escalate it from our side.
15/05/25, 9:08â€¯am - user1: Got it. Thank you. Also, is there any way I can download a mini statement from the app?
15/05/25, 9:09â€¯am - user2: Yes. Just open the app > Go to Accounts > Tap on your savings account > Tap on 'View Mini Statement'. You can also download it as a PDF from there.
