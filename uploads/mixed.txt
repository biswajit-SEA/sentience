15/05/25, 1:15â€¯pm - user1: Hi, I wanted to report a suspicious transaction on my account.
15/05/25, 1:15â€¯pm - user1: An amount of â‚¹2,149 was debited from my account at 12:22 PM, but I didnâ€™t make that transaction.
15/05/25, 1:16â€¯pm - user2: Hello. That sounds concerning. Could you share the last 4 digits of your account and whether your card is still with you?
15/05/25, 1:17â€¯pm - user1: Yes, account ending 0041. And yes, my card is with me.
15/05/25, 1:18â€¯pm - user2: Alright. Iâ€™m blocking your card right now as a precaution. Youâ€™ll need to file a dispute form.
15/05/25, 1:18â€¯pm - user2: You can do that from our app > Cards > Dispute Transaction or visit the branch.
15/05/25, 1:19â€¯pm - user1: Thatâ€™s the problem. Your app keeps crashing whenever I open the Cards section. Been like that for days.
15/05/25, 1:19â€¯pm - user2: Weâ€™re really sorry about that. Our tech team is working on the crash issue reported by several users. In the meantime, would you like me to raise the dispute manually?
15/05/25, 1:20â€¯pm - user1: Yes, please. That would be helpful.
15/05/25, 1:21â€¯pm - user2: Done. Your complaint has been logged. Youâ€™ll receive an SMS confirmation shortly.
15/05/25, 1:22â€¯pm - user2: The refund process will take 7â€“10 working days if the transaction is found fraudulent.
15/05/25, 1:22â€¯pm - user1: Okay. Thatâ€™s better. But please fix the app soon, itâ€™s genuinely frustrating.
15/05/25, 1:23â€¯pm - user2: Totally understand. Weâ€™ve already prioritized the issue. Really appreciate your patience.
15/05/25, 1:24â€¯pm - user1: Alright. Thanks for your help today.
15/05/25, 1:24â€¯pm - user2: You're welcome. We're here if you need anything further. ðŸ˜Š
