My experience with their banking service has been quite frustrating. The mobile app crashes frequently, and basic transactions take too long to process. When I tried to reach customer support about an unauthorized charge, I was passed around between departments without a clear resolution. For a service thatâ€™s supposed to handle money, the lack of efficiency and accountability is disappointing.
