# Azure App Service Error Resolution Guide

Based on the error logs you shared, I've created this guide to help you fix your Azure App Service deployment. The issue is with importing modules correctly in your Python Flask application.

## Step 1: Update Your GitHub Repository

1. Make sure these updated files are pushed to your GitHub repository:
   - `app_azure_simplified.py` (new file)
   - `startup.txt` (updated to use app_azure_simplified)
   - `web.config` (for proper configuration)

## Step 2: Configure Azure App Service

1. In the Azure Portal, go to your App Service
2. Go to "Configuration" under Settings
3. Under Application Settings, add or update:
   - `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT` = `true`
   - `PYTHONPATH` = `site\\wwwroot`
   - `WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM` = `false`
   - Any environment variables your app needs

4. Under General Settings:
   - Make sure Python 3.10 is selected
   - In Startup Command, enter:
     ```
     gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8000 app_azure_simplified:app
     ```

## Step 3: Check Your Requirements

Your application error is likely related to missing dependencies. Make sure your `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary packages:

```
Flask>=2.0.0
gunicorn>=20.0.0
SQLAlchemy>=2.0.0
Flask-SQLAlchemy>=3.0.0
Flask-Login>=0.6.0
Flask-WTF>=1.0.0
Flask-Migrate>=4.0.0
Flask-Mail>=0.9.1
email_validator>=2.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

## Step 4: Deploy and Restart

1. After pushing changes to GitHub, your App Service should automatically deploy
2. Manually restart your App Service from the "Overview" page
3. Wait for the restart to complete (can take a few minutes)

## Step 5: Check Logs

1. Go to "Log stream" under Monitoring in your App Service
2. Watch for any new error messages

## Step 6: Debugging Further Issues

If you still encounter issues:

1. Look for specific error messages in the logs
2. Try to access the `/health-check` endpoint directly (added in app_azure_simplified.py)
3. Check if all your Python files are in the correct locations in the App Service

## Common Issues:

1. **Module import errors**: Make sure all your modules (like models/) are properly included in your deployment
2. **Database errors**: If your app requires a database, ensure connection strings are correct
3. **File path errors**: Azure App Service may handle paths differently than local development
4. **Dependency issues**: Make sure all required packages are in requirements.txt

## For More Help:

- Check the Kudu console (Advanced Tools) to browse your app's files on the server
- Use the SCM site (https://your-app-name.scm.azurewebsites.net) for more detailed logs
- Consider enabling Application Insights for better monitoring
