15/05/25, 11:04 am - user1: I made a withdrawal from the ATM this morning at 10:25 AM, ₹5,000 got debited but I didn’t get the cash.
15/05/25, 11:05 am - user1: This is the second time in two months this has happened.
15/05/25, 11:08 am - user2: Hello. Sorry for the inconvenience. Can you share the ATM location and your account number’s last 4 digits?
15/05/25, 11:08 am - user1: Location was Axis Bank ATM, Rajdhani Market, Bhubaneswar. Account ends with 8721.
15/05/25, 11:10 am - user2: Thank you. Please wait while I verify the transaction.
15/05/25, 11:15 am - user2: I’ve checked. The transaction is showing as “successful” on our side. You’ll need to wait up to 7 working days for auto-reversal.
15/05/25, 11:15 am - user1: 7 DAYS? Are you serious? It’s *your ATM glitch*, why should I wait so long?
15/05/25, 11:16 am - user2: Sir, as per interbank transaction policy, the amount reversal depends on the reconciliation process of the acquiring bank.
15/05/25, 11:16 am - user1: I don’t care about your policy. I want my money back.
15/05/25, 11:17 am - user2: Sir, please calm down. We understand your concern, but this is the standard process. You can also raise a complaint through our app under “Service Request”.
15/05/25, 11:17 am - user1: Already done. No response there either.
15/05/25, 11:18 am - user2: Let me check that for you as well. Please hold.

15/05/25, 11:22 am - user1: Yeah sure. Doesn’t matter anymore.
